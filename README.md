# My Data Science/ML/AI Journey

This repository is intended to contain all the different resources and code snippets to get a detailed intuition of what data science actually is as I walk through it, discovering the path of Data Science. A large part of this repository is inspired by Siraj Raval's 100 Days of ML Challenge.

I will try to capture the big picture here not just few lines of python library to develop the intutuion behind the algorithms, practices and will try to bridge the knowledge gap between Statistical Analysis, Predicitve Modelling, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and other concepts that confuses with these terms.

The key point is to stick to a plan that works for you and be consistent. Give yourself couple of months of undivided attention towards Data Science Field till you are confident enough to Frame a problem, know whether a problem can be solved by Machine Learning, if yes how to built a pipline, and what algorithm works for it.

## Getting Started

1. Bulding your Base
    - [Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVKj3LADCnA&list=PL221E2BBF13BECF6C&index=1)
    - Statistics
    - Calculus
    - Probablity 
    - Algorithm and Design

2. Machine Learnig 
    - [Python for Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg)
    - Maths of Intelligence
    - Inroduction to TensorFlow
    - Udacity's Machine Learning Intoduction course
    
### Prerequisites

1. Commit 2-3 Hours Daily to learning
2. Install python/distribution and Jupyter Notebooks.
3. At end of the day/week try to write a simple python code/project
